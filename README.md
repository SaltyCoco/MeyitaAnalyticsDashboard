<h1>Meyita Analytics Dashboard</h1>

<h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>
        Questions, concerns and comments are always welcome.  All data gathered 
        for this dashboard will be available in it's raw format with references to where I got it from.  Lastly, if
        anybody has problems with anything presented please email said concern to ryan.j.schulte@gmail.com.
    </p>
    
<h3>Web Application</h3>
    <p>
        This website was built using plotly's dash library.  Dash is basically an awesome graphing 
        library similar to D3.js built on top of flask.  I am also using a dash-bootstrap theme for
        the css.
    </p>
    
    - Database 
        
        An AWS postgres database was created for this dashboard but was not included in the finished
        product.  I basically used it for etl purposes as I am comfortable with sql / T-sql.  The queries
        were ran and dumped to csv files.  If anybody wants a copy of the db I can send you the pg_dump file.  
        
    - Calculations
        
        The majority of calculations were made using python pandas.  Pandas is the standard for this 
        type of dashboard.
